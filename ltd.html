<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dt><strong>Does the LTD plan provide benfeits for my spouse or dependents?</strong></dt>
<dd>No. However, if you are disabled for three months or more, and receive benefits under this coverage, upon your death a Survivor Benefit, equal to three times the scheduled monthly benefit, will be paid in a lump sum to your surviving spouse or dependent children under age 25. If there is no surviving spouse or dependent child under age 25, no benefits will be paid.</dd>

<dt><strong>For how long is the benefit payable?</strong></dt>
<dd>If you are disabled prior to age 60, long-term disability benefits are payable until you attain Normal Retirement Age, as determined by the Social Security Act. If you are disabled after age 60, disability benefits will be paid for a period ranging from one to five years depending on your age when you became disabled.</dd>

<dt><strong>After I am approved for LTD, how soon is the benefit payable?</strong></dt>
<dd>After satisfying the waiting period of six months from the time you are disabled and provided you are not actively at work and not on payroll, you are eligible to start receiving the benefits.</dd>

<dt><strong>If I receive other income benefits for my disability will my LTD benefit be affected?</strong></dt>
<dd>Your LTD Monthly Income Benefit will be offset by the amount you receive from other sources including Social Security, Workers' Compensation, and your pension plan.</dd>
