<h2>Life & Waiver Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Do I have to answer any medical questions to qualify for benefits?</strong></dt>
<dd>If you are enrolled in Basic Life, you do not have to answer any medical questions for benefits. If you are enrolled in Voluntary Life, you will be required to answer medical questions only if you purchase a coverage amount that is greater than 3 times your salary or more than $300,000.</dd>

<dt><strong>How much life insurance can I elect?</strong></dt>
<dd>Basic Life is paid for by your employer and you are automatically enrolled for 2 times your salary, not to exceed $400,000. If you choose to enroll in Voluntary Life you can elect up to 8 times your salary, not to exceed $1,000,000.</dd>

<dt><strong>How much life insurance can I elect for my spouse/children?</strong></dt>

<dt><strong>Can I receive any Life insurance benefits while I'm still living?</strong></dt>
<dd>You may receive benefits while you are still living. If diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live, you can receive a one-time payment of 80% of your elected benefit, not to exceed $820,000.</dd>

<dt><strong>When does my coverage end?</strong></dt>
<dd>Your coverage will end when you no longer work for the company, fail to pay your monthly premium, are no longer in "active service", or if policy is canceled by your employer or insurance company.</dd>

<dt><strong>What happens to my coverage when I'm no longer an employee?</strong></dt>
<dd>In order to continue your life insurance, you will need to apply for an individual whole life policy within 62 days from the day your coverage ends.</dd>
